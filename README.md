# Analog Front End (AFE) for Biopotential Signal Sensing

This repository presents the design, development, and implementation of an Analog Front End (AFE) tailored for biopotential signal sensing. Leveraging CADENCE VIRTUOSO, the AFE circuitry interfaces with biological signals such as electrocardiograms (ECG), electroencephalograms (EEG), and electromyograms (EMG). This project underscores the pivotal role of AFEs in bridging the gap between biological phenomena and digital signal processing, thus fostering applications in healthcare diagnostics and physiological monitoring.
